# Shortest-Path-Visualizer
A dynamic and interactive web application for visualizing shortest path algorithms. This project allows users to see how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, and DFS operate step-by-step on a grid. The visualizations make it easier to understand how these algorithms explore paths and find the optimal solution.

# Features

Interactive Grid Creation: Draw walls and weights directly on the grid to customize the pathfinding scenario.

# Multiple Algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm

A* (A-Star) Algorithm

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Step-by-Step Visualization: Watch the algorithm's decision-making process in real time.

Speed Control: Adjust the visualization speed for a better learning experience.

Custom Start and End Points: Drag and drop start and end nodes on the grid.

Reset and Clear Options: Easily reset the grid or clear walls and paths.

# Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shortest-path-visualizer.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd shortest-path-visualizer

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

# Usage

Launch the application and customize your grid.

Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.

Place the start and end nodes by dragging them on the grid.

Draw walls or weighted nodes as needed.

Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action.

Adjust the speed slider to control the visualization speed.

Use the "Reset" or "Clear" buttons to modify the grid.
