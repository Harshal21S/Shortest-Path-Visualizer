# Shortest-Path-Visualizer
A dynamic and interactive web application for visualizing shortest path algorithms. This project allows users to see how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, and DFS operate step-by-step on a grid. The visualizations make it easier to understand how these algorithms explore paths and find the optimal solution.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid Creation**: Draw walls and weights directly on the grid to customize the pathfinding scenario.

- **Multiple Algorithms**:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm

- A* (A-Star) Algorithm

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- Depth-First Search (DFS)

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch the algorithm's decision-making process in real time.

- **Speed Control**: Adjust the visualization speed for a better learning experience.

- **Custom Start and End Points**: Drag and drop start and end nodes on the grid.

- **Reset and Clear Options**: Easily reset the grid or clear walls and paths.
